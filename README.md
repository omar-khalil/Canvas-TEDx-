# Canvas-TEDx-
A 3D art app made for a TEDx talk that I gave in 2019, where the audience created abstract art and each piece was combined in one large canvas at the end of the talk.
You can watch the talk here (although there's a lot I would change today, ngl): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VdMmY25YaY
